# Deploys the backend microservice - cities-service.
# This microservice reads city data from a database and exposes Restful endpoints for CRUD(ish) actions
#
# The function creates an instance template, instance group, autoscaling group, internal load balancer and healthcheck.
# The app spins up a basic in-mem db and loads in test data on first load. It can be configured ot use CloudSQL or a.n.other if needed.

# Utility function to define firewall rules.

#   - Enables traffic between the front-end HTTP load balancer (and healthchecks) to the cities-ui app (on port tcp:8080)
#   - Enables traffic between internal load balancer (and it's healthchecks) to the cities-service apps (on port tcp:8081)
#   - Enables traffic between the cities-ui layer and the cities-service layer (on port tcp:8081)
